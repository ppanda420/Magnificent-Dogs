        <h1>Short and Amazing Lives of Beagles</h1>
    </div>

    <p>
        The beagle is a breed of small scent hound, similar in appearance to the much larger foxhound.
        The beagle was developed primarily for hunting hare, known as beagling.
        Possessing a great sense of smell and superior tracking instincts,
        the beagle is the primary breed used as a detection dog for prohibited agricultural imports and foodstuffs
        in quarantine around the world.
        <br><br>
        The beagle is a popular pet due to its size, good temper, and a lack of inherited health problems.
        The modern breed was developed in Great Britain around the 1830s from several breeds,
        including the Talbot Hound, the North Country Beagle,
        the Southern Hound,
        and possibly the Harrier.
        <br><br>
        Beagles have been depicted in popular culture,
        since Elizabethan times in literature and paintings and more recently in film, television,
        and comic books.

        <h1>History</h1>
    </div>
    <p>
        The origin of the beagle is not known.
 In the 11th century, William the Conqueror brought the St. Hubert Hound and the Talbot hound to Britain.
 In Britain,both of these strains were then crossed with Greyhounds to give them speed and stamina for deer hunting.
Beagles are similar to the Harrier and the extinct Southern Hound, though they are smaller and slower.
